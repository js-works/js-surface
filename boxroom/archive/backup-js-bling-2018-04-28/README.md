# jsBling

A pure functional API for building UI components - with adapters for
React, Preact and Vue.

Side effects are handled by middleware - any Redux compatible middleware
is fine (means: to be really "pure functional" you have to use a
"pure functional" Redux middleware, of course)

Important: This project is in alpha state.
